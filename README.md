# My Awesome kotlin Android list
## *PREFACE*
For a reason, I needed to learn how to build an android app. As I already know how to code in java and kotlin is rising in popularity, I took it as a chance to learn this new and beautiful language - KOTLIN.
Never having developed a native android app before, it was difficult to learn both. 

So here I want to list some resources, which helped me a lot to understand and build an android app as a newbie.



## websites
* [Android Arsenal] - just search for ...
* [android.com] - official developer documentation
* [kotlinlang.org] - official kotlin site
## videos
* [How to Kotlin - Google I/O '18] 
* [yt channel: Reso Coder] 
*  [yt channel: EDMT Dev] 
*  [yt channel: CodeAndroid] 
*  [yt channel: Coding in Flow]
*  [yt channel: Apps In The Sky]
## git
### - finished projects to learn from
* [JetBrains/kotlinconf-app] - maybe one of the best examples (for [Kotlin/anko]) 
* [webianks/BlueChat] - bluetooth chat : learn bluetooth and customized layout
* [CapTechMobile/TransportDirectory] - learn JetPack's Room, ViewModel, LiveData, and WorkManager.
* [abhinav272/NewsApp] - learn JetPack's Room, ViewModel, LiveData, and WorkManager.
 
### - nice libraries
